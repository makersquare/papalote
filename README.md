## SF-Cohort 2 Final Project

## Getting Started

1. run `bundle install`
2. run `gem install figaro`
  * run `figaro install`
3. create the following files, and **populate with your local enviroment data**:
  * *There are examples of these files within the directory.*
  * create and populate: `config/database.yml`
  * create and populate: `config/application.yml`
    * application.yml holds all the secret api keys and other non public information.
    * **This file should not be uploaded to git**
4. Setup the database (step 3 must be completed)
  * run `rake db:create db:migrate`

At this point you should be able to run: `rails s` or `bundle exec rails s` and the server should start.
Go to `http://localhost:3000/#/` or `http://10.10.10.10:3000/#/` and the application should be running with a silly landing page which tests that all the assets are avaliable.

## Git Workflow

This section will be in two parts, the first is merely a list of the commands that you will be using as well as an explanation of what they do.  The second part will be the typical workflow you should all follow which will limit the ammount of merge conflicts and other git related issues that can occur when working in a large team.

### Git Commands

* `git fetch`
	* the command `git pull` performs a g `git fetch` right before it actually pulls
	* `git fetch` will compare your local repo with the remote BUT NOT make changes to your local
	* commonly used to check if a pull --rebase is necessary
* `git pull --rebase <remote> <cur_branch>`
	* this command will rewind all your changes to the last commit.
	* then it will fastforward the external changes and combine them with your own
	* this command differs from `git merge` by the fact that it attempts to lay the changes in sequential order that they where applied compared to your own changes.
	* it is recommend that you use `git pull --rebase <remote> <cb>` often and before pushing your changes up.  This will keep your local branches current with the changes on the remote.
* `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`
	* first is creates a new branch
	* next it checks that branch out
* `git add ./`
	* this adds all files that have been changed
* `git add .`
	* this adds every single file regardless if it has been changed or not
* `git commit -m "commit message"`
* `git rebase HEAD~#`
	* `#` <- is a place holder for an integer
	* this command will allow you to squash commits
	* say we have a feature branch and have made 20 commits to the feature branch, the feature is completed and ready to merge into development
	* we want to run `git rebase HEAD~20` this will open a vim window which will allow us to squash commits int oa single commit

### Git Workflow

* **Master** is a pristine branch **DO NOT** push to it directly without prior approval, significant testing and a code review.
* **Staging** is a pristine branch used to test updates about to be pushed to *Master*
* **Development** or **Dev** is the main development branch and the one that you should be branching from in order to create issue branches.
* **(Issue Branch)** This is an issue branch.  Say, I was assigned the task of created a ORM.  I would create a branch *off of Development* where I would work.
	* It is **IMPERATIVE** that you **DO NOT** pull and merge (User1 Issue Branch) with (User2 Issue Branch), IE two feature branches,  this will taint the git repo and cause massive ammounts of merge conflicts

###### Here is a scenario

I have been tasked with creating a user login system.  Another developer has created the necessary backend omniauth connection.  The other developer has merged their branch into development.  My local dev branch currently **DOES NOT** have these changes and has a older version of the Dev Branch.

1. Update my local dev branch with the remote
	* (I am currently in the development branch)
	* `git pull --rebase origin development` (from development)
2. create my feature/issue branch
	* `git checkout -b login` (from development)
	* (I am now in the login branch)
3. Test!!!!!
4. Code!!!!!
5. Test!!!!!
6. Get your code peer reviewed - this is mandatory!
7. `git rebase HEAD~#` (from feature branch)
	* squash our commits into a single one as to not clutter the log history
8. Update your branch with changes from the development branch
	* `git fetch` (from feature, this will work for all branches in the repo regardless of where you currently are)
	* IF Development has changed run the following to update
	* `git checkout development`
	* `git pull --rebase origin development`
	* `git checkout <feature_branch>`
	* `git rebase development` (if there are merge conflicts, you will fix it here)
	* IF you have a merge conflict, do the following:
	* Fix the files that have the conflicts
	* `git add <file-name>`
	* `git rebase --continue`
	* (repeat the last 3 steps as necessary)
9. `git checkout development`
10. `git merge <feature_branch>`
11. `git push origin development`
12. You can now delete your feature branch - `git branch -d <feature_branch>`
